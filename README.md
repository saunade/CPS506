This repo holds some labs and all three assignments that represent what I learned in CPS506
*No smalltalk image has been uploaded, but this was a language also explored*

Each tester folder was my boggle solver assignment, where I had to insert code that implemented DFS to solve a given letter matrix
Solving consisted of finding all possible letter arrangements that formed a valid word, no repeats.
I completed this in Elixir, Haskell and Rust.

The files I added were Boggle.hs for the haskell tester, Boggle.ex for the elixir tester, main.rs for the rust tester.

The rules for what I was provided are located in the PDF
